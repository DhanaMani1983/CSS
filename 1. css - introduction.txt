CSS - Cascading Style Sheet

CSS is used to beautify HTML documents 

Why CSS?

HTML with font and color was difficult to read and understand, very difficult to change
because changes need to be made at different places. Where as with CSS changes can be made
at one place and applied to HTML document. CSS is easily managable.


Adding Styles:

Within Element- With any HTML tag we can add style
Head Section - Styles can be added in head section of html document 
External file - Most popular way, where styles are specified in the external file
Linking external file- <link rel="stylesheet" href="" type-"text/css"/>
rel is relationship

CSS Levels:

CSS Specs - http://www.w3.org/style/css/

CSS1 - 1996 - Fonts, colors, alignment, spacing
CSS2 - 2004- Layout, positioning
CSS3 - Effects, sizing, speech.

Style Rules:
What CSS declares is a style rule, below whole body section is a rule where body is selector.
where we specify name value pair background-color is name and gray is value

body{
   background-color:gray;
   padding:10px;
}

Simple Selector:

Tag selector - HTML tag selector
ID selector - Can declare id for an element and apply style rule for that particular element with id.
should declare using #id
Class Selector - If you want to apply style rule to group of elements use class selector
should declare using .classname

Multiple selection can be done using comma seperated 

Other Selector:

Descendant selector - Style rule is applied to the last element in reference example Div p{}
Style is applied to paragraph element within div.

Child selector - Style rule is applied to the first child of the parent example Div>p{}
Style is applied to first child paragraph within div.

:first-child- First item will be styled.

Attribute selector - Add style to attribute eg p[width]{color:gray;}

Pseudo Class - A:visited{}, A:hover{}

CSS comment- /* */

Specifying Property Values:

Style rules are defined as name value pairs, where name is the property and value is the assignment to the property. value can be
specified as follows

Keywords - thin, thick larger, blue, red green. the before are keywords

Physical measurements - height, width can be specified using physical measurements such as inches, points, pc

Screen measurements - pixels

Relative measurement - if measurements in units is not available or recognisable then specify relative measurements
% eg 40 % or em - which means relative to current size 1 em = current size 1.2 em = 1.2 * current size
em is good for using in text in different streams eg desktop, mobile etc

ColorCodes- #rrggbb, rgb(r,g,b) use rgb color picker. 

Font - use font name

Function notation - rgb, url function
