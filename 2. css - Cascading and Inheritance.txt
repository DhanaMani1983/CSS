#############################################

Introduction to Cascading

Cascading - Property can be defined in one place and it is applied for element in all place

eg div{} style will be applied to all div in the document.

Introduction to Cascading -Ambiquity

Because of cascading there can be ambiquity which arises.

Cascade:

How ambiguity occurs in cascading?

Each browser will have default stylesheet(least weight)

User stylesheet will have more weightage, where each user will set accessibility in the browser

Styles from different sources

Author stylesheet gets highest weightage.
<link> - link external style sheet
<import> - import styles from other style sheet

Ordering rules:

Last rule takes highest precedence
!important is specified precedence is ignored
If multiple stylesheets are specified or linked, the style rule in the latest file will be considered.

Inspect element in chrome:

Developer tools are available in all tools
To inspect an element right click an element and click inspect

Specificity:

*Takes least specificity 
Tag selection Next level
Tag Tag selection next level
Tag.class selection next level
Id selection Highest level of specificity.

Inheritance:

If the property is set at container level, the propery will be pushed to all members in the child

HTML -> Body -> H1, H2, Div, P, Div ->

Certain properties will not be copied eg borders.

Inheritable:

Font size, Font color, Font family, List item, List style.
